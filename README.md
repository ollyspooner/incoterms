# Incoterms

## Description

International Commercial Terms (‘Incoterms’) are internationally recognised standard trade terms used in sales contracts. They’re used to make sure buyer and seller know:

* who is responsible for the cost of transporting the goods, including insurance, taxes and duties
* where the goods should be picked up from and transported to
* who is responsible for the goods at each step during transportation

This data source has been manually compiled from a variety of sources. While the 2010 (8th) version can be sourced from https://datahub.io/core/icc-incoterms, the latest is the 2020 (9th) version for which no easily accessible free data source could be found. Details on the 2020 version can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incoterms, along with descriptions of no longer used Incoterms.
Older versions of the terms have been added to this data source mainly for interest. The precise version that a term was introduced or had its name changed has been inferred or in some cases guessed at and should not be considered authoritative.
